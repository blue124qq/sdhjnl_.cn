<hr>
<p><b><u>If you are under 16, 15, 14 or 13</u></b></p>
<p>If you are under 16 and live in Croatia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia or Slovenia, you may only use this site if you have confirmed your parent, guardian, carer or teacher has granted you permission to access iDEA and provided their name and email address.</p>
<p>If you are under 15 and live in the Czech Republic or France, you may only use this site if you have confirmed your parent, guardian, carer or teacher has granted you permission to access iDEA and provided their name and email address.
</p>
<p>If you are under 14 and live in Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Italy, Lithuania, UK or Spain, you may only use this site if you have confirmed your parent, guardian, carer or teacher has granted you permission to access iDEA and provided their name and email address.</p>
<p>If you are 13 or under and live anywhere else in the world, you may only use this site if you have confirmed your parent, guardian, carer or teacher has granted you permission to access iDEA and provided their name and email address.</p>
<p><b><u>Our legal basis for processing your personal information</u></b></p>
<p>We promise that we shall only use your data in the way you wish, and we shall always respect your privacy. We process your data under the following legal grounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance of a contract: where the processing is necessary for us to deliver our services to you, and to provide you with your badges, Record of Achievement, certificates and awards.</li>
<li>Legitimate interests: the lawful justification for sending you email marketing communications about our business, services and news is because we have a legitimate business interest for your data to be used for this specific purpose. You are in complete control of your data and can choose not to receive these messages, either when you first provide your data, or in every communication we send you afterwards. If you are under 16 in Germany, Hungary and the Netherlands, or under 13 anywhere else in the world, we will provide a link to this privacy policy so your parent and/or guardian is aware of our legal basis for processing your personal information. </li>
<li>Legitimate interests: we may also match the data we collect with other data that we hold about you if you have been connected with iDEA before. We do this because we have a legitimate business interest to send you only relevant messages. To do so, we need to build up a picture of your personal preferences and understand how you use iDEA.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Data processors</u></b></p>
<p>We use our own staff, and we also use a small selection of third party companies to process some data on our behalf. We only use processors with clear GDPR commitments, and only in the legitimate interest of running iDEA to deliver our services. </p>
<ul>
<li>Companies who provide services on our behalf:
<ul>
<li>Amazon Web Services who hosts our platform and most of our badges</li>
<li>MailGun who distributes our emails</li>
<li>Secarma who conduct our cyber security testing</li>
<li>HelpScout who supports our CRM</li>
<li>HotJar who supports our performance management</li>
<li>Salesforce, Barclays, Century, Digital Portfolios, Raspberry Pi and Proversity who host some of our badges</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We shall keep your personal data within iDEA and our trusted third parties except where disclosure is required by law, for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p><b><u>How long we keep your personal information</u></b></p>
<p>We only keep your personal information for as long as we need to, so that we can use it for the reasons described above. Where your information is no longer required or is no longer relevant, we will make sure it is disposed of securely.</p>
<p>The actual period for which we store your personal information will vary depending on the type of personal information and how it is used. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of our service is providing you with badges, awards and your Record of Achievement so you can demonstrate skills, knowledge and information you have acquired to future employers and other bodies. We shall therefore keep a record of all your achievements until you tell us you do not wish us to do so.</li>
<li>You will always be able to access the website using your login if you wish to, but if your account is dormant for more than five years we shall archive your contact data. </li>
<li>If you tell us to stop sending you emails that are not service-related, we shall keep a record of that instruction with your contact details. We shall hold that information indefinitely unless you tell us otherwise.</li>
<li>Where necessary, we shall keep your personal data for as long as required to do so by law; and where required to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Data transfers</u></b></p>
<p>Your personal data may be stored, processed, and transferred outside the EEA to the UK, so that we can use your personal data as described in this policy.</p>
<p>We will make sure that any transfers of your personal information from one country to another comply with those data protection and privacy laws which apply to us. European data protection laws include specific rules on transferring personal information outside the EEA.</p>
<p>When transferring personal information outside the EEA, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission for transferring personal information outside the EEA into our contracts with those third parties (these are the clauses approved under Article 46.2 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)); or</li>
<li>Ensure that the country in which your personal information will be handled has been deemed "adequate" by the European Commission under Article 45 of the GDPR.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Links to other websites</u></b></p>
<p>Our website may contain links to and details of other websites that are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you that will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours. It will be helpful for you to read their Privacy Policy before providing them with your personal data.</p>
